# Project Overview: <br>
This project is a real-world data cleaning simulation designed to practice data wrangling and documentation. It includes a small retail data set and a large HR dataset to imitate the types of data analysts often work with in industry. The goal of this project is to apply multiple tools (Excel, Python, notebooks) and produce clean, analytic-ready datasets.
