# Project Overview: <br>
This project is a real-world data cleaning simulation designed to practice data wrangling and documentation. It includes a small retail data set and a large HR dataset to imitate the types of data analysts often work with in industry. The goal of this project is to apply multiple tools (Excel, Python, notebooks) and produce clean, analytic-ready datasets.
<br>
## Project Structure 
data/               → Raw and cleaned datasets (CSV and Excel) <br>
notebooks/          → Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory cleaning and analysis <br>
excel/              → Excel cleaning work, formulas, and Power Query steps <br>
documentation/      → Data quality report, cleaning rules, issue logs, screenshots <br>
scripts/            → Python scripts for automated data cleaning <br>
## Tools and File Formats Used
### Tools Used
Excel - for manual cleaning, formulas and Power Query <br>
Python (pandas) - For programmatic cleaning of small and large datasets <br>
Jupyter Notebooks - To display code, output and explanations together <br>
Git & Github - For version control and organizing the project
<br>
### File Formats
CSV - Raw and cleaned datasets <br>
XLSX - Excel-based cleaning and formula work <br>
IPYNB - Python cleaning workflows <br>
PY - Automation scripts
MD - Documentation and reports <br>
PNG - Screenshots for visual documentation
## Real-World Data Issue Addressed
This project intentionally includes a wide range of common data problems frequently found in retail and business datasets. These include:

Duplicate records <br>
Inconsistent name formatting <br>
Invalid or malformed email addresses <br>
Multiple phone number formats and missing values <br>
Mixed and incorrect date formats <br>
Inconsistent state abbreviations and casing <br>
Numerical errors such as text-based values, negative totals, or mismatched calculations <br>
Payment method inconsistencies across categories <br>
Missing values across multiple fields <br>

The purpose is to simulate the type of messy real-world data that analysts clean every day and demonstrate the tools and logic required to transform it into a usable dataset.
